# Flask CI/CD Demo 🚀

This project demonstrates a real-world Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using **GitHub Actions**, **Docker**, and deployment to both a **local QA environment** and a **cloud environment**.

---

## 🧠 Project Objective

The goal of this project is to build a simple Python web app and automate the full DevOps lifecycle around it:

- ✅ **CI (Continuous Integration)**:  
  - Lint and test the code (placeholder for now)
  - Build a Docker image

- ✅ **CD (Continuous Deployment)**:  
  - Push the image to a private Docker registry
  - Deploy the app to:
    - 🖥️ A local QA machine (via SSH)
    - ☁️ A cloud server (also via SSH)

This project is designed as a **portfolio-ready example** for DevOps and infrastructure automation.

---

## 🧱 Stack

- **Python + Flask** — lightweight web app
- **Docker** — containerization
- **GitHub Actions** — CI/CD automation
- **Private Docker Registry** — stores built images
- **SSH Deployment** — used to deploy to QA and Cloud machines

---

## 🗺️ Next Steps

- [ ] Add a simple test framework (e.g., `pytest`)
- [ ] Improve error handling in the pipeline
- [ ] Add health checks or rollback logic
- [ ] Explore multi-environment support (staging, prod)
